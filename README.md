### Time-Based Notifications

Code Mantra can show notifications at regular time intervals to remind you to take breaks or follow the Pomodoro Technique:

```json
{
  "codeMantra.timeBasedNotifications": {
    "enabled": true,
    "intervals": [
      {
        "duration": 50,
        "message": "üí° Time to take a break! Step away from your screen.",
        "type": "workBreak",
        "enabled": true
      },
      {
        "duration": 25,
        "message": "üçÖ Pomodoro complete! Take a short break.",
        "type": "pomodoro",
        "enabled": false
      }
    ],
    "resetOn": ["save"]
  }
}
```

**Features:**

- ‚è∞ **Multiple Timers**: Run multiple independent timers simultaneously
- üîÑ **Auto-Reset**: Optionally reset timers on specific events (save, focus)
- üçÖ **Pomodoro Support**: Built-in support for Pomodoro Technique (25 min intervals)
- üíº **Work Break Reminders**: Long-form work session reminders (50 min default)
- üé® **Custom Intervals**: Define your own timing patterns

**Timer Types:**

| Type        | Description                      | Typical Duration |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `workBreak` | Standard work break reminder     | 50 minutes       |
| `pomodoro`  | Pomodoro Technique timer         | 25 minutes       |
| `custom`    | Your own custom interval pattern | 1-120 minutes    |

**Reset Events:**

- `save`: Reset all timers when you save a file (keeps you in flow)
- `focus`: Reset all timers when the editor gains focus

**Tip:** Enable `resetOn: ["save"]` to avoid interruptions during deep work sessions. Your timers will automatically restart each time you save, keeping you in the zone!

## Installation

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "Code Mantra"
4. Click Install

## üõ† Troubleshooting

1. **Reset your settings**

- Open `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)` from the Command Palette
- Remove any `codeMantra.*` entries to return to the defaults
- Save the file and reload VS Code (`Developer: Reload Window`)

2. **Reinstall the extension**

- Uninstall Code Mantra from the Extensions view
- Close all VS Code windows, then reinstall from the Marketplace listing

3. **Still stuck? Open an issue**

- Create a new ticket at [github.com/is0692vs/code-mantra/issues](https://github.com/is0692vs/code-mantra/issues)
- Include your VS Code version, Code Mantra version, relevant `settings.json` snippet, and any log output

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run extension in debug mode
# Press F5 in VS Code
```

## Publishing

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated releases and marketplace publishing.

### Release Workflow (GitHub Release Only)

Triggered by `v*` tags (e.g., `v0.1.0`):

```bash
# 1. Update version in package.json and CHANGELOG.md
# 2. Commit changes
git add -A && git commit -m "Release v0.1.0"

# 3. Create and push tag (triggers release.yml)
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

This creates a GitHub Release with the packaged VSIX file.

### Publish Workflow (GitHub Release + Marketplace)

Triggered by `v*-publish` tags (e.g., `v0.1.0-publish`):

```bash
# After creating a GitHub Release with v0.1.0,
# trigger marketplace publish with:
git tag v0.1.0-publish
git push origin v0.1.0-publish
```

This creates a GitHub Release and publishes to VS Code Marketplace.

### Workflows

- **release.yml**: `v*` tags ‚Üí GitHub Release (VSIX attached)
- **publish.yml**: `v*-publish` tags ‚Üí GitHub Release + Marketplace publish

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- [x] Add extension icon (128x128 PNG)
